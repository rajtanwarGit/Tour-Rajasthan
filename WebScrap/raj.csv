The Matsyas were allies of the Pandavas in the Mahabharata war. Legends say that the origin of the name Bharatpur is traced to Bharat, younger brother of Lord Ram. Laxman, the other brother, was given the most prestigious position as that of the family deity of the ruling family of Bharatpur. His name also appears in the state seals and coat-of-arms.



In the early 18th century, Maharaja Suraj Mal captured the fort of Bharatpur by vanquishing Khemkaran, the rival chieftain and laid the foundation for Bharatpur. The valiant Maharaja was very keen to expand the cities and is credited with building the numerous forts and palaces that dot the kingdom, including the Pleasure Palace Complex at Deeg. 



Bharatpur is also home to one of the world's best-known bird watching destinations, Keoladeo Ghana National Park (KNP). 250 years ago, the then ruler built embankments that allowed flooding of this land, turning it into a marsh. Named after the dense jungle that surrounded an old Shiva Temple, this 29 square kilometre man-made wetland is renowned for migratory birds – ducks, geese, waders, raptors, flycatchers and more. In winter, avid birders and ornithologists flock to the park to observe and study the feathered beauties. With more than 370 recorded species, KNP used to also host the Siberian crane. It is a World Heritage Site.",""

Situated in the eastern part of Rajasthan, Dholpur became a separate district in 1982 comprising four tehsils of Bharatpur – namely Dholpur, Rajakhera, Bari and Baseri. Carved out of Bharatpur district, Dholpur is surrounded by Agra on the north, Morena district of Madhya Pradesh on the south and Karauli on the west.

Ever since its existence, Dholpur remains one of the most fascinating regions in the state that has witnessed the oldest civilizations, and is extremely rich in cultural heritage. It used to be the seat of the Dholpur princely state before Independence, and today is a city of diverse culture and historical grandeur.

The red sandstone from Dholpur is famous throughout the country and was famously used in the construction of the Red Fort in Delhi.



The history of this princely state is known to date back to Buddha’s time. Several centuries ago, Dholpur was a part of the Mauryan Empire and came under the rule of various rulers all along the Mughal period. Around the 8th to the 10th century, Dholpur was known to be ruled by the Chauhans.Until 1194, it continued to be under the rule of Mohammed Gauri.

Dholpur was initially known as Dhawalpuri named after the ruler Raja Dhawal Deo, also known as Dholan Deo Tomar who established the city in 700 AD (though some historians have dated the formation to 1005 AD.) Later, it came to be known as Dholpur.",""

Jaisalmer traces its inception to the 12th century. History tells us of Rawal Jaisal, the eldest heir of the Rawal of Deoraj,  was passed over for the throne of Lodurva and a younger half-brother was crowned king. Rawal Jaisal went looking for a new location to set up his capital when he came across sage Eesul.

above the surrounding plain and appears both to command and to meld
with the landscape. One of the largest forts in Rajasthan, it contains fine
palaces and preserves in its museum many priceless relics of Indian
courtly life.
Jodhpur is named after its founder Rao Jodha, a fifteenth-century chief of
the Rathore clan. In 1459, Rao Jodha (r. 1438-89) began to build a new
fort six miles to the south of Mandore, his then capital. A strategic
location was chosen for the new fort: an isolated rock providing high
elevation and good natural defenses. The fort was named Mehrangarh,
meaning ‘fort of the sun’ – a reference to the clan’s mythical descent from
the Sun god ‘Surya’. Over five hundred yards long, the fort wall is seventy
feet wide and rises in places to a height of one hundred and twenty feet.
Today Mehrangarh Museum has a unique importance as a repository of
the artistic and cultural history of the large areas of Central Rajasthan
and Marwar-Jodhpur. The museum boasts exemplary examples of 17th,
18th and 19th-century collections for the fields of Miniature Paintings,
Arms and Armours, Textiles, Decorative Arts and Furniture.
The Museum has also participated in many international exhibitions all
over the world, displaying and sharing the rich heritage of Marwar, and
interacting with prestigious institutions in the field.

been turned into a Botanical Museum by the Mehrangarh Museum Trust
by planting and in-situ displaying, exquisite endemically historic flora of
Marwar region.
The garden today, as in the past, is truly a celebration of nature as it
captures the changing colors of the seasons in the upper terrace of flower
beds. It is equally magical for night viewing when the Mehtab Bagh or
moonlight garden laid out in the lower terrace comes alive with the white
flowers ofchandni(Tabernaemontana coronaria) and the sweet-
smellingkamini(Maurya exotia). Visit this gem of a garden and carry

It is often referred to as “the food basket of Rajasthan” due to its fertile plains similar to those one would find in Punjab. The area was once barren and dry but was converted to a green town thanks to Maharaja Ganga Singh who constructed the Gang Canal to carry excess water from Punjab and Himachal Pradesh to the town.

Today, Sri Ganganagar is famed for its produce of wheat, mustard, cotton, bajra, sugarcane and grams. Kinnow, a hybrid citrus fruit is a popular horticultural product that is grown here. Majority of the industries in the area are based on agriculture and it provides a livelihood to a majority of the residents of Sri Ganganagar.



In ancient times, two mighty rivers i.e. the Saraswati and the Drishadvati flowed through the area making it home to tribes similar to those belonging to Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa. However, in due course the rivers started to dry up causing a natural calamity that wiped out the tribes and caused Sri Ganganagar to turn into a barren wasteland. During the 15th century, Rao Bika established Bikaner and the territory of Sri Ganganagar was part of the princely State of Bikaner. Finally in 1927, the overhaul of Sri Ganganagar was complete thanks to the Gang Canal constructed by Maharaja Ganga Singh as the city was restored to its former glory.",""

In fact, so impressed was he by the place, that this is what he wrote about the Bundi palace:

‘Jaipur Palace may be called the Versailles of India … Jodhpur’s House of strife, gray towers on red rock, is the work of giants, but the Palace of Bundi, even in broad daylight, is such a palace as men build for themselves in uneasy dreams – the work of goblins rather than of men.’



Bundi is a magnificent town located around 36 kilometres from Kota. Dotted with palaces and forts, the place has a fairy tale quality about it. Bundi’s charm lies in its location –surrounded by orchards of orange, guava, pomegranate and mango trees, flanked by the Aravalli range  and rivers and lined by fields of cotton, barley and wheat. Situated far from the crowds, it is the simple rural folk that lend Bundi its allure. 



Bundi was once ruled by the Hada Chauhans. Many historians claim that it was once the capital of the great Hadoti Kingdom, which was renowned for its art and sculpture. However, in 1624, Kota separated and became an independent state and this marked the beginning of the downfall of Bundi. Whether that may be, Bundi still retains its charismatic medieval grandeur. And just like Jodhpur and Rajput, the architecture of Bundi also possesses a noticeable bluish hue, designed to keep houses cool during hot summer, in the intricately carved brackets and pillars.",""

            Victoria Clock Tower
                Ajmer is a city that has seen major influence from the British in its past.

While a couple of these buildings are located in the heart of Ajmer, one that immediately catches the eye of the visitor is the Victoria Jubilee Clock Tower. Located just opposite the railway station in Ajmer, the monument is an imposing clock tower that was built back in 1887. It is particularly well-known for its architectural beauty, and is quite an impressive example of British architecture, reminding onlookers of a smaller version of the famous Big Ben.

It is a Mughal structure that’s wrapped around water bodies in a garden-like setting. These pavilions boast of a rich history; these were a section of a pleasure garden named Daulat Bagh that was set up by Shah Jahan and Jehangir. During British rule, these five pavilions doubled up as offices. Today, you can see them restored as bona fide pavilions, along with ‘hamam’, the royal bath which is also present at the same place. Anasagar Baradari is a serene place - just sitting by the pavilions and admiring the surroundings makes your heart feel at peace.

The origins of Bikaner can be traced back to 1488 when a Rathore prince, Rao Bikaji, founded the kingdom. Legend has it that Bikaji, one of Rao Jodhaji’s five sons, left his father’s Durbar in annoyance after an insensitive remark from his father, the illustrious founder of Jodhpur.

The way to the temple has rough roads, steep turns and minimal signs of human existence, and all that adds to the mystique surrounding it. A stunning example of the century old, northern architecture and Khajurao-like carvings, the temple will leave you speechless and surprised by its unexpected offerings. It is actually a cluster of temples and open worship places, a good 30 Kilometers into a buffer zone of the tiger reserve, which is exemplified by intricate stone carvings and burgeoning views of the lush forest across the temple landscape. There’s more to the venue than the main Shiv temple. There are two smaller structures behind the temple and when walking up to them, you might bump into some pretty birds, especially peacocks. Interestingly, just about 100 meters from the temple stands an oversized, monolithic stone statue of the Jain Tirthankar Shantinath; to discover it, you will need a little guidance from the locals.

A marvel of architecture, Neemrana Baori looks more like a fortress than a step well. With each floor having a height of about 20 feet, and with 9 floors making up the entire structure, you can imagine how deep it runs. There are no carvings in the structure, maybe because it was built rather later in time, after the more architectural times of earlier centuries. However, the structure still shows all signs of being a glorious building. At the ground level, there used to be colonnaded openings later they had to descend steps to reach the deep water source. The lower steps or floors were of course under water most of the time. In its essence, the Neemrana Baori is a glimpse into the architectural nuances of the past, gazing upon which you shall be thoroughly amazed!

At that time, the township was surrounded by dense forests which were home to many exotic species. The Dewan often came here to hunt and grew so fond of the place that he decided to turn it into a township. It was later turned into a military cantonment when the Maratha invaders passed through the city to capture Hadoti states.",""

                The Udaipur Collection of crystal is one of the largest and most complete collections of Osler cut glass in existence. In both diversity of objects and in the quality and grandeur of the included pieces, it holds a unique place in the decorative art world. Most of this collection was commissioned by Maharana Sajjan Singh in 1878, with the larger commissions of the furniture pieces being given to Osler in 1881.
The exquisite crystal items in the gallery range from dining table, table, sofa set, washing bowl, goblet, tray, decanter, to perfume bottles, candle stands, crockery and even beds. The highlight of the gallery is a jewel studded carpet, embodying peerless class.
The gallery even exhibits a Royal punkah (manually operated fan) in crystal and soft red satin material with the Mewar emblem of the Sun embroidered on it.
The Crystal Gallery exhibits artefacts primarily created by F. & C. Osler, the foremost manufacturers of monumental cut glass luxury objects in the Victorian era and thereafter. Established in Birmingham in 1807, Osler revolutionised the cut glass industry by exploring the material’s structural possibilities, conceiving for the first time a monumental form of crystal, of which the Udaipur Collection is a fine example. F. & C. Osler traded very successfully through much of the 19th century both in Britain and in India.

            AMBER PALACE
                Amber (pronounced Amer) is at a distance of about 11 kilometres from Jaipur. Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it was the bastion of the Kachwahas of Amber, until the capital was moved to the plains, to what is today Jaipur. The palace, located in craggy hills, is a beautiful melange of Hindu and Mughal styles. Raja Man Singh I began construction in 1592 and the palace, which was built as a strong, safe haven against attacking enemies, was completed by Mirja Raja Jai Singh. The contrast between the harsh exterior and the inviting interior couldn’t be more surprising. Made entirely of red sandstone and white marble, visitors are left spellbound by the magnificence of the palace that utilises carvings, precious stones and mirrors. The splendour of the palace is enhanced by the breath-taking vista of the Maota Lake in front. The palace is nearly seven centuries old and has a legendary past. Originally a small structure that the Rajputs won from the Meena tribes, it was later transformed into the grand Amber Palace.

            CITY PALACE
                Located deep within the walled city, the City Palace Complex was conceived and built by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, the founder of Jaipur. A beautiful fusion of Mughal and Rajput architecture, the palace is still home to the last ruling royal family which lives in a private section of the palace. Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II is credited with building most of the structures, but it was expanded upon by later rulers as well. The City Palace Complex includes the Mubarak Mahal (the palace of reception) and the Maharani’s Palace (the palace of the queen). Mubarak Mahal now houses the Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum and displays a vast and unique collection of royal costumes, delicate Pashmina (Kashmiri) shawls, Benaras silk saris, and other dresses with Sanganeri prints and folk embroidery. The clothes of Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh I are also on display. The Maharani's Palace, surprisingly, has an interesting display of very well-preserved Rajput weaponry, some dating back to the 15th century. Other than the arms, the palace is adorned with beautiful paintings on the ceiling that are well-maintained.

                Hawa Mahal, literally the Palace of Winds, was built in 1799 by the poet king Sawai Pratap Singh as a summer retreat for him and his family. It also served as a place where the ladies of the royal household could observe everyday life without being seen themselves. This unique five-storey structure is a blend of Hindu and Islamic architecture, and the exterior, with its small latticed windows (called jharokhas), resembles the crown of Lord Krishna. The windows also serve as an air-conditioner of sorts, blowing cool air throughout the palace, making it the perfect retreat during summers. Built from pink sandstone, the Hawa Mahal is Jaipur’s iconic landmark and visitors can view its complete magnificence from outside, from across the road. However, it is also possible to climb right up to the top for a wonderful view from the windows. Today, the Mahal is maintained by the Archaeological Department of the Government of Rajasthan and also houses an archaeological museum in the courtyard.

It was constructed during the reign of Jai Singh in 1734, and was later expanded in 1868. Nahargarh, which means abode of tigers, was a formidable barrier, defending Jaipur against attacking enemies. Within its walls, the fort houses Madhavendra Bhawan, the summer destination for the members of the royal family. Built by Sawai Madho Singh, the palace has 12 matching boudoirs for the queens, at the head of which is a suite for the king. They are all connected by corridors decorated with delicate murals. Even today the palace is a favoured spot for local picnickers. The fort looks brilliant when floodlit at night. Overlooking the city, it presents a glittering view of the city lights.

The Ganesh temple was built by Seth Jai Ram Paliwal, sometime in the early 18th century. A legend goes, the King of Mewar was heading back to his palace after a long journey and was carting a massive Ganesh idol on a bullock cart. The king had decided that he would build a temple for the idol of Lord Ganesh wherever the bullock cart stopped. Apparently the cart stopped at the foot of the Moti Doongri, which is where the temple is situated today. The hill also has an exotic palace perched right on top. A replica of a Scottish castle, it was once the royal home of Maharaja Sawai Man Singh. It continues to belong to the royal family. The mere view of this castle is extremely exotic.

‘Jagat Shiromani’, meaning ‘Head Jewel of Lord Vishnu’, is an epochal facet of the ancient history of Rajasthan. The temple houses the idols of Lord Krishna, Lord Vishnu and Meera Bai. If we were to go by archaic religious texts, the idols within the temple are actually the ones that Meera Bai, the Hindu mystic poet and devotee of Krishna, worshipped in the State of Mewar.

The Temple's architecture is quite interesting – it is a riveting amalgamation of various architectural styles including Jain, Hindu, Mughal and South Indian. Carved out of white marble and black stone, the walls and ceilings of the temple are covered in exquisite bas relief carvings of elephants, horses, Purans and other legends. The most prodigious feature of the temple is the marble Torans (pylon) or ornamental arches at the entrance, carved out of a single piece of marble.

            AKAL WOOD FOSSIL PARK
                Rajasthan is a treasure trove of history and historical artifacts, but one place in particular takes you beyond the ‘timeline of present’, right into the prehistoric Jurassic era. The Akal Wood Fossil Park is a 21-hectare preserved area that lies about 17 km from Jaisalmer, towards Barmer.180 million years ago, a forest used to stand where the park is today. The area was then submersed into the sea and the tree trunks were preserved in the form of fossils. With remnants of fallen and broken logs that date back to the pre-historic times, the park is an absolute must-visit attraction. Here, you can see large fossilized trunks from trees of different sizes that have been placed in corrugated iron shelters. There are about 25 numb trees, along with centuries-old fossils, and right at the entrance, you can also stroke a fossil of an ancient red-wood tree trunk. In the geological area that had only non-flowering trees, an entire forest comprising of huge trees was fossilized. The presence of these gigantic trees suggests that in the lower Jurassic age, the area had hot and humid climate that was able to support a luxuriant forest, as compared to the stark dry climate of today.

miniatures, and miniature paintings were highly encouraged. From gods and goddesses, battle scenes,
and elephants to images of Radha and Krishna, these paintings depict a special delicacy that is known
only in the region. There’s also a Chitrashala in the Chitra Mahal that was made under orders from

paintings here, making the art glow with the originality of their painters. In its totality, the walls and
ceilings of the Chitra Mahal form a dramatic panaroma that is always worth a visit.

The coins of the Sibi tribe found here have the legend ‘majhamikaya sibi janapadasa’. The Sibi tribes were probably defeated by yavans (Greeks). Patanjali, the contemporary of Pushyamitra Sunga, has mentioned in his Mahabhashya, about the attack of the Yavans (Greeks) on Madhyamika in 150 BC. After then, Nagari came under the influence of the Western Kshatrapa in the 2nd century. In the 3rd century, Nagari was ruled by the Malavas. Later, it was conquered by the Huna king. Major tourist attractions in Nagari include the Ancient Shiva Temple, Hathiyon ka Bara, and Ubhdivat or the Prakash stambh.

According to historian Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha, in 1567, as Akbar’s giant army surrounded the fort of Chittorgarh with an intention to attack the kingdom, the chieftains of Maharana Uday Singh (ruler of the Mewar dynasty, presently Chittorgarh) unanimously decided that it was wise at the moment to send Maharana's family to the hills in the company of some warlords. Following this, the responsibility of protecting the fort was given to Rathod Jaimal and Sisodia Patta. In the war, Jaimal and Patta sacrificed their lives while exhibiting extraordinary valour. Impressed by their fearlessness, Akbar himself ordered the construction of figures of the two brave hearts sitting on their elephant outside the Agra Fort. The statues were later removed by Aurangzeb. In the Chittorgarh Fort, where Jaimal and Patta had lost their lives, one can find a cenotaph made in their honour.
                
            
        

    
        
            
            BHAMASHAH KI HAVELI
                Chittorgarh is a city that resonates with Rajputana pride, passion, and bravery. Full of forts and palaces that let you travel back to the past, Chittorgarh has a number of places of interest that can satisfy a traveler’s soul. One of the lesser known places in the city, Bhamashah ki Haveli elicits a sense of former grandeur that well befits the person it was made for. Bhamashah has held quite an important place in Rajput history, being one of the most well-known ministers to Maharana Pratap. He and his brother Tarachand are well known as warriors of great acumen, having fought a number of battles under MaharanaPratap, including the one at Haldighati. Infact Maharana Pratap ran out of funds for his fight against the Mughals, when Bhamashah and Tarachand gave him their own wealth. Located in front of the topkhana in Chittorgarh, the Haveli has been maintained by the Archeological Survey of India. Surrounded by custard apple trees, there is also a Mahadev temple near the Haveli, and right behind are the Moti Bazaar and Nagina Bazaar as well. At the entrance, you are greeted by a pillared verandah which was most likely used as a place to meet the common folk and guests. Venturing further inside, you can glimpse a number of rooms that rise up to three floors at places. The location of the Haveli is such that it doesn’t see a lot of footfall, but it is one place that is definitely worth a visit the next time you are in Chittorgarh.",""

            kumbhalgarh Fort
                BIRTHPLACE OF MEWAR'S LEGENDARY KING, MAHARANA PRATAP. Located 84 kms north of Udaipur in the wilderness, Kumbhalgarh is the second most important citadel after Chittorgarh in the Mewar region. Cradled in the Aravali Ranges the fort was built in the 15th century AD by Rana Kumbha. The inaccessibility and hostility of the topography lends a semblance of invincibility to the fort. It served the rulers of Mewar as a refuge in times of strife. The fort also served as refuge to King Udai of Mewar in his early childhood when Banbir killed Vikramaditya and usurped the throne. It is of immense sentimental significance for the people being the birthplace of Mewar's legendary king Maharana Pratap. The fort is self-contained in all respect to withstand a protracted siege. Its defences could be breached only once by the combined armies of the Mughal and of Amber primarily for scarcity of drinking water. There is a magnificent array of temples built by the Mauryas of which the most picturesque place is the Badal Mahal or the palace of the clouds. The fort also offers a superb bird’s eye view of the surroundings. The fort's massive wall stretches some 36 kms with a width enough to take eight horses abreast. Maharana Fateh Singh renovated the fort in the 19th century. The fort's large compound has very interesting ruins and a walk around it can be very educative.

                It is a huge expanse of water 66 Km. north of Udaipur, between the towns of RAJNAGAR and KANKROLI. The lake was the result of a dam constructed across the Gomati, Kelwa and Tali rivers at the southwestern end by Maharana Raj Singh I, between 1662 and 1676 AD. The reason for the dam and lake was to provide employment for victims of a widespread drought and famine (1661), and to provide canal irrigation to local farmers. During World War II Rajsamand Lake was used as a seaplane base by Imperial Airways for about six years. Rajsamand Lake is the oldest known relief work in Rajasthan and cost almost 4 million rupees. With a circumference of 22.5 Sq Km. the lake is quite awe- inspiring with a depth of 30ft and a catchment area of about 524 sq km.
