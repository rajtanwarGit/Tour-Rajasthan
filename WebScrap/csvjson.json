    "data": "The history of Bharatpur dates back to 5th century BC, when the Matsya kingdom flourished here. The Matsyas were allies of the Pandavas in the Mahabharata war. Legends say that the origin of the name Bharatpur is traced to Bharat, younger brother of Lord Ram. Laxman, the other brother, was given the most prestigious position as that of the family deity of the ruling family of Bharatpur. His name also appears in the state seals and coat-of-arms.\n\n\n\nIn the early 18th century, Maharaja Suraj Mal captured the fort of Bharatpur by vanquishing Khemkaran, the rival chieftain and laid the foundation for Bharatpur. The valiant Maharaja was very keen to expand the cities and is credited with building the numerous forts and palaces that dot the kingdom, including the Pleasure Palace Complex at Deeg. \n\n\n\nBharatpur is also home to one of the world's best-known bird watching destinations, Keoladeo Ghana National Park (KNP). 250 years ago, the then ruler built embankments that allowed flooding of this land, turning it into a marsh. Named after the dense jungle that surrounded an old Shiva Temple, this 29 square kilometre man-made wetland is renowned for migratory birds – ducks, geese, waders, raptors, flycatchers and more. In winter, avid birders and ornithologists flock to the park to observe and study the feathered beauties. With more than 370 recorded species, KNP used to also host the Siberian crane. It is a World Heritage Site.",

It used to be the seat of the Dholpur princely state before Independence, and today is a city of diverse culture and historical grandeur.\n\nThe red sandstone from Dholpur is famous throughout the country and was famously used in the construction of the Red Fort in Delhi.\n\n\n\nThe history of this princely state is known to date back to Buddha’s time. Several centuries ago, Dholpur was a part of the Mauryan Empire and came under the rule of various rulers all along the Mughal period. Around the 8th to the 10th century, Dholpur was known to be ruled by the Chauhans.Until 1194, it continued to be under the rule of Mohammed Gauri.\n\nDholpur was initially known as Dhawalpuri named after the ruler Raja Dhawal Deo, also known as Dholan Deo Tomar who established the city in 700 AD (though some historians have dated the formation to 1005 AD.)

History tells us of Rawal Jaisal, the eldest heir of the Rawal of Deoraj,  was passed over for the throne of Lodurva and a younger half-brother was crowned king. Rawal Jaisal went looking for a new location to set up his capital when he came across sage Eesul. The sage told him about Krishna’s prophecy which said that a descendant of his Yaduvanshi clan would found a new kingdom at this same spot. It was in 1156 that Rawal Jaisal constructed a mud fort, named it Jaisalmer after himself and declared it his capital.",

It is an impressive piece of architecture and is believed to have been constructed between the 8th and 10th centuries, the fort is perched atop a steep hill at a height of about 336 metres and offers exquisite views of the city below. The highlights of the fort are its high fortified walls and bastions with cannons mounted upon them. The fort has four massive gates but is only accessible from one side, after a two-mile long serpentine ascent.\n                \n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n            TOPEKHANA\n                Located in the midst of Jalore city, Topekhana was once a grand Sanskrit school built by King Bhoj sometime between the 7th and 8th centuries. A scholar of Sanskrit, King Bhoj is known to have built several similar schools in Ajmer and Dhar to impart education. The school was renamed Topekhana during the pre-independence period after officers used the building to store artillery and ammunition. Today, the structure of the building is in disrepair but it is still extremely impressive and is adorned with stone carvings. Two temples flank the Topekhana on either side but they no longer house idols. The most impressive sight of the Topekhana is a room built about 10 feet above the floor of the building with an imposing staircase leading up to it, the room is believed to have been the abode of the headmaster of the school.\n                \n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n            MALIK SHAH'S MOSQUE\n                Commissioned by Ala-Ud-Din-Khilji during his reign over Jalore, the mosque was built to honour Malik Shah, the Seljuk Sultan of Baghdad. The mosque is located in the centre of the Jalore Fort and is particularly distinct for its style of architecture, which is believed to have been inspired by buildings found in Gujarat.\n                \n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n            SIREY MANDIR\n                Located at a height of 646 metres on the Kalashachal hill, the temple is believed to have been built by Rawal Ratan Singh in honour of Maharishi Jabali.

One of the largest forts in Rajasthan, it contains fine\npalaces and preserves in its museum many priceless relics of Indian\ncourtly life.\nJodhpur is named after its founder Rao Jodha, a fifteenth-century chief of\nthe Rathore clan. In 1459, Rao Jodha (r. 1438-89) began to build a new\nfort six miles to the south of Mandore, his then capital. A strategic\nlocation was chosen for the new fort: an isolated rock providing high\nelevation and good natural defenses. The fort was named Mehrangarh,\nmeaning ‘fort of the sun’ – a reference to the clan’s mythical descent from\nthe Sun god ‘Surya’. Over five hundred yards long, the fort wall is seventy\nfeet wide and rises in places to a height of one hundred and twenty feet.\nToday Mehrangarh Museum has a unique importance as a repository of\nthe artistic and cultural history of the large areas of Central Rajasthan\nand Marwar-Jodhpur. The museum boasts exemplary examples of 17th,\n18th and 19th-century collections for the fields of Miniature Paintings,\nArms and Armours, Textiles, Decorative Arts and Furniture.\nThe Museum has also participated in many international exhibitions all\nover the world, displaying and sharing the rich heritage of Marwar, and\ninteracting with prestigious institutions in the field.\n                \n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n            Chokhelao Bagh and Interpretation Center\n                Visit the Chokhelao Bagh which sits at the foot of the Mehrangarh Fort.\nThis over two hundred-year-old garden, complete with the scents,\nsounds, and textures of a garden of the eighteenth century Marwar has\nbeen turned into a Botanical Museum by the Mehrangarh Museum Trust\nby planting and in-situ displaying, exquisite endemically historic flora of\nMarwar region.\nThe garden today, as in the past, is truly a celebration of nature as it\ncaptures the changing colors of the seasons in the upper terrace of flower\nbeds. It is equally magical for night viewing when the Mehtab Bagh or\nmoonlight garden laid out in the lower terrace comes alive with the white\nflowers ofchandni(Tabernaemontana coronaria) and the sweet-\nsmellingkamini(Maurya exotia). Visit this gem of a garden and carry\nback the sensuous experience of eighteenth-century Rajput garden.",

It is often referred to as “the food basket of Rajasthan” due to its fertile plains similar to those one would find in Punjab. The area was once barren and dry but was converted to a green town thanks to Maharaja Ganga Singh who constructed the Gang Canal to carry excess water from Punjab and Himachal Pradesh to the town.\n\nToday, Sri Ganganagar is famed for its produce of wheat, mustard, cotton, bajra, sugarcane and grams. Kinnow, a hybrid citrus fruit is a popular horticultural product that is grown here. Majority of the industries in the area are based on agriculture and it provides a livelihood to a majority of the residents of Sri Ganganagar.\n\n\n\nIn ancient times, two mighty rivers i.e. the Saraswati and the Drishadvati flowed through the area making it home to tribes similar to those belonging to Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa. However, in due course the rivers started to dry up causing a natural calamity that wiped out the tribes and caused Sri Ganganagar to turn into a barren wasteland. During the 15th century, Rao Bika established Bikaner and the territory of Sri Ganganagar was part of the princely State of Bikaner. Finally in 1927, the overhaul of Sri Ganganagar was complete thanks to the Gang Canal constructed by Maharaja Ganga Singh as the city was restored to its former glory.",

In fact, so impressed was he by the place, that this is what he wrote about the Bundi palace:\n\n‘Jaipur Palace may be called the Versailles of India … Jodhpur’s House of strife, gray towers on red rock, is the work of giants, but the Palace of Bundi, even in broad daylight, is such a palace as men build for themselves in uneasy dreams – the work of goblins rather than of men.’\n\n\n\nBundi is a magnificent town located around 36 kilometres from Kota. Dotted with palaces and forts, the place has a fairy tale quality about it. Bundi’s charm lies in its location –surrounded by orchards of orange, guava, pomegranate and mango trees, flanked by the Aravalli range  and rivers and lined by fields of cotton, barley and wheat. Situated far from the crowds, it is the simple rural folk that lend Bundi its allure. \n\n\n\nBundi was once ruled by the Hada Chauhans. Many historians claim that it was once the capital of the great Hadoti Kingdom, which was renowned for its art and sculpture. However, in 1624, Kota separated and became an independent state and this marked the beginning of the downfall of Bundi. Whether that may be, Bundi still retains its charismatic medieval grandeur. And just like Jodhpur and Rajput, the architecture of Bundi also possesses a noticeable bluish hue, designed to keep houses cool during hot summer, in the intricately carved brackets and pillars.",

It was constructed in 1588 AD by Raja Rai Singh, one of Emperor Akbar’s most distinguished generals. The fort complex houses some magnificent palaces constructed in red sandstone and marble and visitors can feast their eyes on an attractive assortment of courtyards, balconies, kiosks and windows.\n                \n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n            NATIONAL RESEARCH CENTRE ON CAMEL\n                The National Research Centre on Camel is 8 kilometres from the city. This camel research and breeding centre is the only one of its kind in Asia. The centre is spread out over 2000 acres of semi-arid land and is managed by the Government of India.\n                \n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n            LALGARH PALACE AND MUSEUM\n                Maharaja Ganga Singh commissioned the construction of this majestic palace. This architectural marvel is made entirely of red sandstone and was built in 1902 to commemorate his father, Maharaja Lal Singh. The design was conceptualised by Sir Swinton Jacob, who created this oriental fantasy by blending Rajputana, Islamic and European architecture.\n                \n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n            RAMPURIA HAVELI\n                Bikaner has several havelis (aristocratic homes), the most famous cluster being the Rampuria Group of Havelis. Built of dulmera (red) stone, every aspect of the havelis – jharokhas (casements), entrances, latticed windows, divankhanas, gumaharias or basements – is simply exotic. Leaves and flowers decorate every jharokha, lending it a pleasant touch. These massive havelis are decorated with golden work of the highest quality. Their dankhanas (drawing room) take one back to the Mughal and Rajput era. One can notice an abundance of Victorian influence in their design as well. The wood carvings in Rampuria Havelies are extremely exquisite. Spaced close to each other, the havelis are truly a sight to behold.\n                \n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n            GANGA GOVERNMENT MUSEUM\n                Described as the best museum in the State, the museum contains a rich display of archaeological artefacts from Harappa and the early Gupta periods.

Built between 1898 and 1902 by British architect Sir Samuel Swinton Jacob, this structure displays an Indo-Saracenic architectural style. It is now a luxury hotel.\n                \n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n            PRACHINA MUSEUM\n                Located in the great Junagarh Fort, this museum hosts royal costumes, textiles and accessories of Rajasthani royalty. The 'Poshaks' (garments worn by ladies) are a reminder of the now lost craft of traditional designs, styles and workmanship. The family portraits on display narrate a story about how changing cultural settings influenced the style of immortalising the former rulers.\n                \n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n            DESHNOK KARNI MATA TEMPLE\n                The Karni Mata Temple at Deshnok is a beautiful structure made of stone and marble, inside which resides an image of Karni Mata.

The fort is said to have been constructed by a chief of the Balnote clan of Rajputs. The fort houses two temples, one dedicated to Lord Shiva called Jaleshwar and the other dedicated to Krishna called Bada Mandir.",

Popularly known as the 'Gateway to Ranthambore', the town has seen many historic episodes and reigns. Sawai Madhopur has partly plain and partly undulating hilly terrain. The South and south east part of the district has hills and broken ground which form a part of a vast track of rugged region enclosing the narrow valley of the Chambal river. Surrounded by Vindhyas & Aravalis, this place is a treat for adventure enthusiasts as well as the ones with a fascination for history, with the Ranthambore National park- the most renowned national park in northern India and the Ranthambore Fort which was recently included in the list of UNESCO’s World Heritage sites, being the main attractions. \n\n\n\nPassed on from the Chauhan Rajput king, Govinda to Vagabhatta, from RanaKumbha to Akbar and Aurangzeb, the city has been patronized by almost all the rulers. Beautification and renovation of the city has been regularly undertaken in almost all the regimes. Under the rule of Rao Hammir, the last Chauhan ruler the Ranthambore region prospered magnificently. In ancient India the region was more popularly known as Ranthambore. It was much later that it received the name, Sawai Madhopurfrom Maharaja SawaiMadhoSinghji I who is believed to have given the city its current plan in 1765 AD. During the British Rule Sawai Man Singh built a railway line between Jaipur and Sawai Madhopur. As a result it became accessible from a central spot in the state of Rajasthan. Today it has grown as one of the popular tourist destination in India. \n\nFormer state of Karauli, Ranthambore was amongst the strongest forts of medieval India and is linked to Prithviraj, the ruler of Shakambhari who has golden cupolas put on the Jain temple of Ranthambore. To check the increasing incurious of the Marathas, Madho Singh, the ruler of Jaipur State requested for the grant of the fort of Ranthambore but did not succeed.",

Built in the 13th century, the shrine is popular among people of all faiths who flock here to have their prayers answered. The shrine has three gates – the main gate or the Nizam gate, the Shah Jahan gate erected by the Mughal Emperor and the Buland Darwaza. Another big draw at this holy shrine is the sacred and scrumptious food that is served to devotees. Cooked in giant cauldrons known as ‘degs’, devotees gather in throngs to be blessed by this prasad.\n                \n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n            ADHAI DIN KA JHONPDA\n                The Adhai Din Ka Jhonpda was originally built to function as a Sanskrit college but was later converted into a mosque by Sultan Ghori in 1198 AD. An impressive blend of Indo-Islamic architecture, the structure was further beautified by Sultan Iltutmish in 1213 AD. Legend has it that the mosque is known as Adhai din ka Jhonpda (literally meaning, The Hut of Two and a Half Days) because of a two and half day fair held here during Urs in the 18th century.\n                \n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n            Mayo College\n                Mayo College is one of India’s oldest independent boarding schools. Founded in 1875, and named after Richard Bourke, the 6th Earl of Mayo, Mayo College was set up to provide the scions of India’s princely states with an education similar to that provided by the Eton College in Britain. John Lockwood Kipling, father of Nobel Laureate, Rudyard Kipling, as principal of Mayo College, furnished the design of the Coat of Arms which shows a Rajput and a Bhil warrior. The college building is one of the finest extant examples of Indo-Saracenic style of architecture.\n                \n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n            Anasagar Lake\n                Anasagar Lake is a scenic artificial lake, commissioned and built by Arnoraj Chauhan, son of Ajaypal Chauhan, between 1135 and 1150 AD. Arnoraj was also known as Anaji, which gives the lake its name. Many years later, Mughal Emperor Jahangir added his touch to the lake by laying out the Daulat Bagh Gardens near the lake. Emperor Shah Jahan too, contributed to the expansion by building five pavilions, known as the Baradari, between the garden and the lake.\n                \n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n            Soniji ki Nasiyan\n                Soniji ki Nasiyan, also known as the Ajmer Jain Temple, is a wonderful example of ornate architecture, and is dedicated to Risabh or Adinath. Its entrance is made of red stone and the marble staircase inside is engraved with images of the holy Tirthankars – omniscient teachers of Jain faith who taught righteousness. Constructed in the late 19th century, this temple is counted among the richest temples in India. Its main chamber, Swarna Nagari (City of Gold), is aptly named so because of the several gold-plated wooden figures it houses within its walls. This famous architectural marvel finds a mention in Kurt Titze's book, ‘Jainism: A Pictorial Guide to the Religion of Non-Violence.’\n                \n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n            Lake Foy Sagar\n                A beautiful artificial lake that appears flat, Lake Foy Sagar was built by an English engineer, Mr. Foy in 1892 AD. Interestingly, this work was taken up to provide famine relief through wage employment to locals. Lake Foy Sagar offers a beautiful view of the Aravalli range.\n                \n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n            Nareli Jain Temple\n                The Nareli Jain Temple in Ajmer, also known as the Shri Gyandoaya Tirth Kshetra, is situated on the outskirts of Ajmer on the national highway to Jaipur. This modern edifice is celebrated for being a perfect blend of traditional and contemporary architectural styles. It consists of 24 miniature temples in its vicinity. Known as Jainalay, they represent the Jain Thirthankars. The Nareli Jain Temple is an important point of pilgrimage for Digambara Jains.\n                \n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n            Sai Baba Temple\n                Spread over an area of over five bheegas (or over two acres) at Ajay Nagar, the Sai Baba Temple in Ajmer was constructed by Suresh K Lal, a resident of the Garib Nawaz City in 1999. It’s one of the most recent pieces of architecture and is very popular among all Sai Baba devotees. The temple is built with the purest form of marble that possesses the unique quality of a translucent stone, allowing light to pass through it. Every Sai Baba disciple should definitely visit this shrine once in their lifetime.\n                \n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n            AJMER GOVERNMENT MUSEUM\n                The Ajmer Government Museum serves as one of the prime tourist destinations in Ajmer.

The main gateway of the Taragarh, which consists of two colossal bastions on both sides with strong guard rooms, has sculptures of elephants adorning it. The main highlights of this once magnificent fort are its water reservoirs and the Bhim Burj, on which the canon called Garbh Gunjam (Thunder from the Womb) was mounted. There is also the magnificent Rani Mahal with its stained windows and murals, which used to house the wives of the rulers. All this makes the Taragarh Fort a nonpareil example of Rajaputana architecture that’s also a major attraction for tourists visiting Ajmer.

The British left their legacy in many forms in Ajmer, some of which are in the form of educational institutions and architectural buildings in the city. While a couple of these buildings are located in the heart of Ajmer, one that immediately catches the eye of the visitor is the Victoria Jubilee Clock Tower. Located just opposite the railway station in Ajmer, the monument is an imposing clock tower that was built back in 1887. It is particularly well-known for its architectural beauty, and is quite an impressive example of British architecture, reminding onlookers of a smaller version of the famous Big Ben.\n                \n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n            Prithvi Raj Smarak\n                Prithvi Raj Smarak is a memorial made in the honour of the brave Rajput chief, Prithvi Raj Chauhan III. Regarded as the epitome of devotion and courage, he was the last ruler of the Chauhan lineage and was enthroned to rule over the twin capitals of the Ajmer and Delhi, in 12 th century. The memorial exhibits the statue of Prithvi Raj III seated on his horse, made in black stone. The horse has one of its front hooves up in the air, as if charging forward. The memorial stands atop a hill, surrounded by the Aravalli range, giving visitors a panoramic view of the city of Ajmer. The memorial also has a garden adjacent to it, wherein tourists can sit and relax. \n                \n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n            Anasagar Baradari\n                The white marble pavilions present on the south eastern embankment of the beautiful Ana Sagar Lake in Ajmer are called as Anasagar Baradari. It is a Mughal structure that’s wrapped around water bodies in a garden-like setting. These pavilions boast of a rich history; these were a section of a pleasure garden named Daulat Bagh that was set up by Shah Jahan and Jehangir. During British rule, these five pavilions doubled up as offices. Today, you can see them restored as bona fide pavilions, along with ‘hamam’, the royal bath which is also present at the same place. Anasagar Baradari is a serene place - just sitting by the pavilions and admiring the surroundings makes your heart feel at peace. This place is a must-visit for the calmness and rich history that the place has to offer.\n                \n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n            Shahid Smarak, Ajmer\n                Paying reverence to the mighty and brave has been a practice that’s ingrained into the very soul of Rajasthan, and the same can be observed in the city of Ajmer too. Walking around the city, you are likely to come around structures and memorials, which offer homage to great warriors and martyrs, born in the princely state.\nOne such structure established in commemoration of the sacrifices of brave souls is the Shahid Smarak in Ajmer. Located right in front of the railway station, this memorial stands in plain sight and is quite easy to reach. \nLocal authorities and townsfolk gather around the Shahid Smarak on numerous occasions to pay tribute to the martyrs. Decorated with colourful lights and fountains, the memorial makes for a beautiful sight to behold.",

Legend has it that Bikaji, one of Rao Jodhaji’s five sons, left his father’s Durbar in annoyance after an insensitive remark from his father, the illustrious founder of Jodhpur.

The exquisitely decorated ancient temple was built to commemorate the eighth Tirthankar, Shri Chandra Prabha Bhagwan.

The way to the temple has rough roads, steep turns and minimal signs of human existence, and all that adds to the mystique surrounding it. A stunning example of the century old, northern architecture and Khajurao-like carvings, the temple will leave you speechless and surprised by its unexpected offerings. It is actually a cluster of temples and open worship places, a good 30 Kilometers into a buffer zone of the tiger reserve, which is exemplified by intricate stone carvings and burgeoning views of the lush forest across the temple landscape. There’s more to the venue than the main Shiv temple. There are two smaller structures behind the temple and when walking up to them, you might bump into some pretty birds, especially peacocks. Interestingly, just about 100 meters from the temple stands an oversized, monolithic stone statue of the Jain Tirthankar Shantinath; to discover it, you will need a little guidance from the locals.

The first sight itself hints at how glorious the place must have been in the past. A marvel of architecture, Neemrana Baori looks more like a fortress than a step well. With each floor having a height of about 20 feet, and with 9 floors making up the entire structure, you can imagine how deep it runs. There are no carvings in the structure, maybe because it was built rather later in time, after the more architectural times of earlier centuries. However, the structure still shows all signs of being a glorious building. At the ground level, there used to be colonnaded openings later they had to descend steps to reach the deep water source. The lower steps or floors were of course under water most of the time. In its essence, the Neemrana Baori is a glimpse into the architectural nuances of the past, gazing upon which you shall be thoroughly amazed!\n                \n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n            Lal Masjid, Tijara\n                The mosque situated to the east of Tijara Town is popularly known as Lal Masjid. It is approximately 55 km from Alwar city. The red sandstone structure is rectangular with minars at four corners and arched doorways. The three arched doorways open into a hall which used to have three domes. The southern dome, however, has fallen. Faint Arabic inscriptions are painted at places on the plastered surface in the northern part of the hall.\n\nEntry timing: Sunrise to Sunset",

At that time, the township was surrounded by dense forests which were home to many exotic species.

Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it was the bastion of the Kachwahas of Amber, until the capital was moved to the plains, to what is today Jaipur. The palace, located in craggy hills, is a beautiful melange of Hindu and Mughal styles. Raja Man Singh I began construction in 1592 and the palace, which was built as a strong, safe haven against attacking enemies, was completed by Mirja Raja Jai Singh. The contrast between the harsh exterior and the inviting interior couldn’t be more surprising. Made entirely of red sandstone and white marble, visitors are left spellbound by the magnificence of the palace that utilises carvings, precious stones and mirrors. The splendour of the palace is enhanced by the breath-taking vista of the Maota Lake in front. The palace is nearly seven centuries old and has a legendary past. Originally a small structure that the Rajputs won from the Meena tribes, it was later transformed into the grand Amber Palace.\n                Explore\n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n            CITY PALACE\n                Located deep within the walled city, the City Palace Complex was conceived and built by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, the founder of Jaipur. A beautiful fusion of Mughal and Rajput architecture, the palace is still home to the last ruling royal family which lives in a private section of the palace. Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II is credited with building most of the structures, but it was expanded upon by later rulers as well. The City Palace Complex includes the Mubarak Mahal (the palace of reception) and the Maharani’s Palace (the palace of the queen). Mubarak Mahal now houses the Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum and displays a vast and unique collection of royal costumes, delicate Pashmina (Kashmiri) shawls, Benaras silk saris, and other dresses with Sanganeri prints and folk embroidery. The clothes of Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh I are also on display. The Maharani's Palace, surprisingly, has an interesting display of very well-preserved Rajput weaponry, some dating back to the 15th century. Other than the arms, the palace is adorned with beautiful paintings on the ceiling that are well-maintained.\n                Explore\n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n            JANTAR MANTAR\n                Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Jantar Mantar in Jaipur is considered to be the largest of the five astronomical observatories built by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, the founder of Jaipur.

It also served as a place where the ladies of the royal household could observe everyday life without being seen themselves. This unique five-storey structure is a blend of Hindu and Islamic architecture, and the exterior, with its small latticed windows (called jharokhas), resembles the crown of Lord Krishna. The windows also serve as an air-conditioner of sorts, blowing cool air throughout the palace, making it the perfect retreat during summers. Built from pink sandstone, the Hawa Mahal is Jaipur’s iconic landmark and visitors can view its complete magnificence from outside, from across the road. However, it is also possible to climb right up to the top for a wonderful view from the windows. Today, the Mahal is maintained by the Archaeological Department of the Government of Rajasthan and also houses an archaeological museum in the courtyard.\n                Explore\n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n            ALBERT HALL MUSEUM (CENTRAL MUSEUM)\n                The building gets its name from The Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the inspiration for its design. The exquisitely built Albert Hall is housed in the centre of Ram Niwas Garden. Sir Swinton Jacob (who is also the mastermind behind many other palaces in Rajasthan) conceptualised and designed it using styles from the Indo-Sarcenic architecture and the Prince of Wales laid the foundation stone of the building in 1876.

It was constructed during the reign of Jai Singh in 1734, and was later expanded in 1868. Nahargarh, which means abode of tigers, was a formidable barrier, defending Jaipur against attacking enemies. Within its walls, the fort houses Madhavendra Bhawan, the summer destination for the members of the royal family. Built by Sawai Madho Singh, the palace has 12 matching boudoirs for the queens, at the head of which is a suite for the king. They are all connected by corridors decorated with delicate murals. Even today the palace is a favoured spot for local picnickers. The fort looks brilliant when floodlit at night.

Built on an elevated platform, this comparatively modern temple is built entirely of white marble and dominates the skyline of south Jaipur. The temple was commissioned and built by renowned Indian industrialists, the Birlas, in 1988. The temple is dedicated to Lord Vishnu, also called Narayan, and his companion, Lakshmi, the Goddess of wealth and good fortune. The temple is a work of art and has a marvellous display of exquisite carvings and sculptures covering many mythological themes. The eye is drawn to the images of Laxmi and Narayan, carved as they are, from one piece of marble. The top of the temple has three domes, each representing the three religions followed in India. This is designed to pay homage to secular India. The temple looks spectacular at night when it is lit up. Other than the main temple, the complex has a museum that exhibits the earlier belongings of the Birla family.\n                Explore\n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n            JAL MAHAL\n                One of the most wonderful sights in Jaipur is the beautiful Jal Mahal or Lake Palace.

Visitors go there to pay homage at the famous Ganesh temple, the most auspicious and important religious temple in Jaipur. The Ganesh temple was built by Seth Jai Ram Paliwal, sometime in the early 18th century. A legend goes, the King of Mewar was heading back to his palace after a long journey and was carting a massive Ganesh idol on a bullock cart. The king had decided that he would build a temple for the idol of Lord Ganesh wherever the bullock cart stopped. Apparently the cart stopped at the foot of the Moti Doongri, which is where the temple is situated today. The hill also has an exotic palace perched right on top. A replica of a Scottish castle, it was once the royal home of Maharaja Sawai Man Singh. It continues to belong to the royal family.

Between August and September, a large fair known as Ramdevra Fair is held here, and it attracts large numbers of devotees who sing devotional songs all night long.\n                \n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n            JAISALMER WAR MUSEUM\n                “If you ate today, thank a farmer, and if you ate in peace, thank a soldier!” Our military and defense forces spend their days facing perils and hardships, so the citizens of India can sleep peacefully. While we all appreciate and hold respect for all they do for us, the Indian Army has commemorated the sacrifices of their soldiers in a beautiful display at this war museum, situated at the Jaisalmer military base. This exhibit is primarily to pay respect to all the soldiers who took part and lost their lives in the 1965 India-Pakistan war and the 1971 Longewala battle. A visit to this museum lets you see a number of captured tanks and other memorabilia from the battle, instilling a sense of immense pride in your country and its soldiers.

Located on the Jaisalmer-Jodhpur Highway, the museum has free entry, and holds a very important part of our country’s history. It is truly one of the places that you cannot afford to miss.\n                \n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n            LAUNGEWALA WAR MEMORIAL\n                One of the first major engagements in the Western sector during the Indo Pakistani War of 1971, the Battle of Laungewala is an inspiring tale of courage in the face of unconquerable odds. A shining example of the courage, bravery, and valor of the Indian soldiers, the Battle of Laungewala created history on 4 December, 1971, when about a hundred Indian defenders halted the advancing troops of about 2000 Pakistani soldiers and 60 tanks. To celebrate the grit and steely resolve of the Indian soldiers who stalled Pakistani forces from their aim of cutting deep into the Indian Territory, the Desert Corps at Laungewala have constructed the Laungewala Was Memorial. An inspiring destination, this war memorial commemorates the valor and the supreme sacrifice of our brave soldiers, instilling in you a sense of pride when you visit this site\n                \n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n            AKAL WOOD FOSSIL PARK\n                Rajasthan is a treasure trove of history and historical artifacts, but one place in particular takes you beyond the ‘timeline of present’, right into the prehistoric Jurassic era. The Akal Wood Fossil Park is a 21-hectare preserved area that lies about 17 km from Jaisalmer, towards Barmer.180 million years ago, a forest used to stand where the park is today. The area was then submersed into the sea and the tree trunks were preserved in the form of fossils. With remnants of fallen and broken logs that date back to the pre-historic times, the park is an absolute must-visit attraction. Here, you can see large fossilized trunks from trees of different sizes that have been placed in corrugated iron shelters. There are about 25 numb trees, along with centuries-old fossils, and right at the entrance, you can also stroke a fossil of an ancient red-wood tree trunk. In the geological area that had only non-flowering trees, an entire forest comprising of huge trees was fossilized. The presence of these gigantic trees suggests that in the lower Jurassic age, the area had hot and humid climate that was able to support a luxuriant forest, as compared to the stark dry climate of today.\n                \n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n            VYAS CHHATRI\n                Located in Bada Bagh in Jaisalmer, Vyas Chhatri is one of the most beautiful examples of Rajasthani architecture. This old Brahmin cemetery, full of local versions of cenotaphs, is dedicated to Ved Vyaas, the sage who wrote the epic, Mahabharata. Filled with cenotaphs all throughout, this place is more popularly referred to as the sunset point of Jaisalmer. Every evening, hordes of people visit the Vyas Chhatri to get a glimpse of the beautiful desert sunset. Everywhere around here you can see beautiful golden sandstone chhatris that are covered in intricate and delicate carvings. A popular destination among tourists, Vyas Chhatri offers a bird’s eye view of Jaisalmer, the fort, and even the adjoining areas. Visitors can also witness a number of locals at Vyas Chhatri, playing Rajasthani tunes on the algoza, a double fluted instrument, making it an experience that astounds the senses.\n                \n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n            AMAR SAGAR LAKE\n                Amar Sagar Lake, located about 7 km towards the western outskirts of Jaisalmer, is a lake cum oasis lying adjacent to the Amar Singh Palace. The palace itself was built in the 17 th century. The complex that includes the palace and the lake is also home to several ponds and wells, along with an old temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. Numerous figureheads of animals carved in stone surround the lake, and according to legends, these carved figureheads are supposed to be protectors of the royal family. At one end, there are pavilions with stairs that lead down to the lake; while at the other end is a beautiful, aesthetically carved Jain temple. A peaceful and tranquil place, the Amar Sagar Lake is yet another spot in Jaisalmer where you have an opportunity to watch a gorgeous sunset.",

The Shikar Burj is actually an old hunting cottage that was built and owned by the rulers of Bundi, and is located at a little distance from Sukh Mahal.\nShikar Burj is nestled amidst the sun dappled forests of Bundi and was the place to which Umed Singh, the ruler of Bundi in the 18th century, withdrew to after he had renounced the throne. Near Sarbagh, Shikar Burj has now been converted into a popular picnic spot and is a great place to spend an evening, relaxing after a day of sightseeing.",

In the ancient era, it was known as Majhimika or Madhyamika .According to the inscription found in Barli, near Ajmer; in 443 BC, this town was named as Majhimika. It was a flourishing town from the Mauryan period, and remained so up to the Gupta period. The excavations found here are surrounded by many interesting facts and show the signs of strong Hindu and Buddhist influence. A large number of punch marked coins, along with other old coins were also found in the excavations. In the first century, Nagari was ruled by the Sibi tribes. The coins of the Sibi tribe found here have the legend ‘majhamikaya sibi janapadasa’. The Sibi tribes were probably defeated by yavans (Greeks). Patanjali, the contemporary of Pushyamitra Sunga, has mentioned in his Mahabhashya, about the attack of the Yavans (Greeks) on Madhyamika in 150 BC. After then, Nagari came under the influence of the Western Kshatrapa in the 2nd century. In the 3rd century, Nagari was ruled by the Malavas. Later, it was conquered by the Huna king. Major tourist attractions in Nagari include the Ancient Shiva Temple, Hathiyon ka Bara, and Ubhdivat or the Prakash stambh.\n                \n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n            BHAINSRORGARH FORT\n                Bhainsrorgarh Fort is perched on a steep slate ridge, about 200 feet high, surrounded by the Chambal and Brahmani rivers. It is located 235 kilometers north-east of Udaipur and 50 kilometers south of Kota. Upon seeing this grand fort and its fascinating beauty, British historian Colonel James Todd once said that if he was offered a jagir (estate) in Rajasthan and given the option to choose, it would be Bhainsogarh. This fort has a remarkable history, it was built by Rawat Lal singh-II son of Rawat Kesari Singh of Salumber. Bhainsrorgarh was granted to Lalsingh as jangeer by Maharana Jagat Singh II of Mewar in 1741 AD. and there are various legends about this place. But, there is no accurate information about who built the fort and exactly when it was built. However, the Bhainsrorgarh Fort is believed to be built in the 2nd century and there are several folklores about who built the fort. It passed through the hands of several clans before becoming a part of the Mewar Kingdom. It is believed that Allauddin Khilji also attacked this fort and destroyed all the old temples and buildings, that’s why the older history of this fort still remains unknown. Bhainsrorgarh Fort has now been converted into a luxury heritage hotel by the erstwhile royal family. Surrounded by rivers on three sides and nestled among the Aravali ranges and dense forests, the beauty of this fort attracts tourists from all over the world.\n                \n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n            TEMPLES OF BAROLI - RAWATBHATA\n                The ancient temples of Baroli, a wonderful example of Hindu architecture, was built by the Huna rulers in the 9th Century, and is located on the confluence of Brahmani and Chambal rivers in Rawatbhata which is at a distance of 115 km from Chittorgarh district. The main temple in these is the Ghatseshwar Mahadev temple, apart from which there are 9 temples within the temple complex. The Shringar Chauri built opposite to the Ghateshwar Mahadev Temple is the premise of the marriage ceremony of ruler Allaat of Mewar and Huna Princess Hariyadevi. Through this marriage, a connection between the Guilla and the Hunas was established.\n                \n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n            JAIMAL AND PATTA’S PALACE\n                Located inside the the Chittorgarh Fort, Jaimal and Patta’s Palace is a symbol of the bravery and gallantry of the Rajputs. According to historian Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha, in 1567, as Akbar’s giant army surrounded the fort of Chittorgarh with an intention to attack the kingdom, the chieftains of Maharana Uday Singh (ruler of the Mewar dynasty, presently Chittorgarh) unanimously decided that it was wise at the moment to send Maharana's family to the hills in the company of some warlords. Following this, the responsibility of protecting the fort was given to Rathod Jaimal and Sisodia Patta. In the war, Jaimal and Patta sacrificed their lives while exhibiting extraordinary valour. Impressed by their fearlessness, Akbar himself ordered the construction of figures of the two brave hearts sitting on their elephant outside the Agra Fort. The statues were later removed by Aurangzeb. In the Chittorgarh Fort, where Jaimal and Patta had lost their lives, one can find a cenotaph made in their honour.\n                \n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n            BHAMASHAH KI HAVELI\n                Chittorgarh is a city that resonates with Rajputana pride, passion, and bravery. Full of forts and palaces that let you travel back to the past, Chittorgarh has a number of places of interest that can satisfy a traveler’s soul. One of the lesser known places in the city, Bhamashah ki Haveli elicits a sense of former grandeur that well befits the person it was made for. Bhamashah has held quite an important place in Rajput history, being one of the most well-known ministers to Maharana Pratap. He and his brother Tarachand are well known as warriors of great acumen, having fought a number of battles under MaharanaPratap, including the one at Haldighati. Infact Maharana Pratap ran out of funds for his fight against the Mughals, when Bhamashah and Tarachand gave him their own wealth. Located in front of the topkhana in Chittorgarh, the Haveli has been maintained by the Archeological Survey of India. Surrounded by custard apple trees, there is also a Mahadev temple near the Haveli, and right behind are the Moti Bazaar and Nagina Bazaar as well. At the entrance, you are greeted by a pillared verandah which was most likely used as a place to meet the common folk and guests. Venturing further inside, you can glimpse a number of rooms that rise up to three floors at places. The location of the Haveli is such that it doesn’t see a lot of footfall, but it is one place that is definitely worth a visit the next time you are in Chittorgarh.",

Located 84 kms north of Udaipur in the wilderness, Kumbhalgarh is the second most important citadel after Chittorgarh in the Mewar region. Cradled in the Aravali Ranges the fort was built in the 15th century AD by Rana Kumbha. The inaccessibility and hostility of the topography lends a semblance of invincibility to the fort. It served the rulers of Mewar as a refuge in times of strife. The fort also served as refuge to King Udai of Mewar in his early childhood when Banbir killed Vikramaditya and usurped the throne. It is of immense sentimental significance for the people being the birthplace of Mewar's legendary king Maharana Pratap. The fort is self-contained in all respect to withstand a protracted siege. Its defences could be breached only once by the combined armies of the Mughal and of Amber primarily for scarcity of drinking water. There is a magnificent array of temples built by the Mauryas of which the most picturesque place is the Badal Mahal or the palace of the clouds. The fort also offers a superb bird’s eye view of the surroundings. The fort's massive wall stretches some 36 kms with a width enough to take eight horses abreast. Maharana Fateh Singh renovated the fort in the 19th century.

The lake was the result of a dam constructed across the Gomati, Kelwa and Tali rivers at the southwestern end by Maharana Raj Singh I, between 1662 and 1676 AD. The reason for the dam and lake was to provide employment for victims of a widespread drought and famine (1661), and to provide canal irrigation to local farmers. During World War II Rajsamand Lake was used as a seaplane base by Imperial Airways for about six years. Rajsamand Lake is the oldest known relief work in Rajasthan and cost almost 4 million rupees. With a circumference of 22.5 Sq Km. the lake is quite awe- inspiring with a depth of 30ft and a catchment area of about 524 sq km. As large as it is, the lake has been known to disappear in times of severe drought: for instance in 2000 it was merely a huge, empty basin with a surface of dried, cracked mud.",
